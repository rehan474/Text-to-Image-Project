Text-to-Image GAN Project
Title:Text-to-Image Synthesis using GANs

Overview:
This project demonstrates a basic text-to-image synthesis system using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Given a simple text input—specifically, a flower name such as "rose" or "jasmine"—the system generates a corresponding flower image. The focus of this project is on exploring the fundamental concepts of GAN-based image generation and understanding how textual descriptions can be mapped to visual representations.

Features:
Text-to-Image Conversion: Converts user-provided flower names into synthesized images.
Basic GAN Architecture: Uses a simple GAN model with a generator and discriminator for image synthesis.
Dataset Integration: Utilizes a locally stored dataset with separate folders for each flower category.
Image Visualization: Displays generated images and saves them for later analysis.
Command-Line Interface: Offers a simple interface for user input and output display.
Modular Design: Separates data preprocessing, model training, and image generation for easy enhancements.

Installation
Clone the Repository:


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Text-to-Image-GAN.git
cd Text-to-Image-GAN
Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:


python -m venv venv

# Windows (PowerShell):
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
Install Dependencies:


pip install -r src/requirements.txt
Setup the Dataset:

Place the raw dataset in data/raw/flowers_dataset/, ensuring it contains subfolders for each flower category.
Run the preprocessing script (if applicable):

python src/data_preprocessing.py
Usage
Training the Model
To train the GAN model on the processed dataset:


python src/training_script.py
The trained model weights will be saved in the models/ folder.

Generating Images
To generate an image based on text input:


python src/generate_image.py
Enter a flower name when prompted. The generated image will be displayed and saved in the outputs/ folder.

Future Work
Dataset Expansion: Increase the number of flower categories and images.
Model Enhancements: Improve the GAN architecture for higher resolution and more detailed outputs.
User Interface: Develop a GUI for easier interaction.
Extended Applications: Explore other domains for text-to-image synthesis.
